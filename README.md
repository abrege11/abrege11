## Abraham Brege - About Me
I am currently a prospective PhD student studying QEC while also interested in the methods of education for quantum algorithms

I work as a Full Stack Web Developer at Northcross Group full time developing web applications using React and Node.js. 

My current project is PQCV, which visualizes quantum circuits constructed by the user.

My goal with PQCV is to explore the new ways that could help new students understand the subject.
